# Spy-check
For this project we will be creating a simple website that asks a visitor questions using the JS and the prompt() function.
Through these questions you will secretly be checking to see if there is a spy present!.
The Spy is going to answer the questions in a very particular way.
Behind the scenes you will use JS to check for these certain correct answers to the questions.
If you find the Spy, you will leave a message in the console for them to check!.
You will need to check the part_9.html file for the full instructions.
An example solution is located under part_9.js , so remember to link to your own .js script before getting started!.
